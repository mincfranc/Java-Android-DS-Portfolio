## Summary

[//]: # (TODO Replace this paragraph with one or more paragraphs summarizing the purpose and operation of the Android app you propose to develop in this project.)

## Intended users and user stories

[//]: # (TODO Write a bullet list here, including at least 2 different types of intended users. Along with each type of intended user, include at least 1 _user story_. A user story is usually just 1 simple sentence &#40;no more than 2 sentences&#41;, in the voice of the intended user, stating a specific task that the user performs using the app, and the benefit that will be obtained. See rubric for required form.)

## Functionality

[//]: # (TODO List &#40;using a bullet list---or ordered list, if order is relevant&#41; the key functional aspects that will be provided by the app---i.e., tell us what the user will be able to do using the app. This should not simply be a re-statement of the [summary]&#40;#summary&#41;, but should instead provide a more specific articulation of the functionality and user experience. )

## Persistent data

[//]: # (TODO Using a bullet list, list what content will be maintained in server-side storage. This should include any information that users of your app would expect to be maintained &#40;i.e., without connection to a server&#41; across multiple sessions of use.)

## Device/external services

[//]: # (TODO If the client component will need to access special services of the client device &#40;e.g., sensors, contacts, messaging&#41;, list them here using a bullet list. Also, if the client component will need to access already-existing external services &#40;e.g., real-time weather data, Open Movie Database, Open Trivia Database&#41;, those should also be listed here.)

## Stretch goals and possible enhancements 

[//]: # (TODO If you can identify functional elements of the software that you think might not be achievable in the scope of the project, but which would nonetheless add significant value if you were able to include them, list them here. For now, we recommend listing them in order of complexity/amount of work, from the least to the most.)
